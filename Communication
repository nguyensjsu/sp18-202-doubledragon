This journal is for keeping recod of team XP Core Value "Communication". - Heli Desai

Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

Communication is a value necessary for the success of an Agile team. We communicated with all the team members about which design patterns to implement for the project. After that, we divided the work amongst the team members.

We used three primary approaches to interact with each other :
1. We were constantly asking "how can I help?" whenever direction isn't already clear.
2. Timely and thorough communication and responses via email, text, and phone.
3. Chcecking in with each other before we make personal decisions that affect the larger group.

Throughout entire project work, all team members shared their views and opinions. With Open Communication in our mind, we were able to complete the entire proejct work successfully with the help of each other.

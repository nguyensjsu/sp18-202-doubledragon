This journal is for keeping recod of team XP Core Value "Communication". - Heli Desai

Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

Communication is a value necessary for the success of an Agile team. We communicated with all the team members about which design patterns to implement for the project. After that, we divided the work amongst the team members.

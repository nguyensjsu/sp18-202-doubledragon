# This page is about XP Core Value - Feedback.

- We will stick to our commitment and we will deliver our software early. 
- So that on regular basis, we can demonstrate our software early for changes needed in our product. 
- Frequently taking valuable feedback will be most helpful in making improvements and changes to reach to the final product.

- It's very helpful to take feedback from peers to analyze progress and find flaws. 
- On regular basis, we discussed our thoughts with each others to get feedback and do correction according to each other's  
  valuable feedback. 
  
- For design patterns assigned to everyone, each one gave some suggestions and ideas of their system. Everyone explained their      
  module's functionality to get feedback from others.  
  
- Everyone presented their developed modules to demonstrate how they have implemented functionality. So that others can find 
  flaws if there is any and give their suggestions for improvement. 

- During this week, Team discussed about Testing final game. Everyone suggested their 
  ideas and provided feedback to others.

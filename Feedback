# This page is about XP Core Value - Feedback.

- We will stick to our commitment and we will deliver our software early. 
- So that on regular basis, we can demonstrate our software early for changes needed in our product. 
- Frequently taking valuable feedback will be most helpful in making improvements and changes to reach to the final product.

- It's very helpful to take feedback from peers to analyze progress and find flaws. 
- On regular basis, we discussed our thoughts with each others to get feedback and do correction according to each other's  
  valuable feedback. 
  
- For design patterns assigned to everyone, each one gave some suggestions and ideas of their system. Everyone explained their      
  module's functionality to get feedback from others.

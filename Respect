This will record XP core Value - "Respect"

The team worked together in harmony and in sync and tried to understand the project requirements.
Each and every team member listened to every ones opinion and suggestions were incorporated as deemed useful.

The team respects the background that every team member comes from and the advantage that has, as it provides us with different
opinions and perspectives. This also helps in making the end product (which in this case is a game ) interesting and helps in 
covering most of the cases if not all.

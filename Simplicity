This page is about XP value - "Simplicity" - by Jigar Soni

We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs.

We have followed simplicity in the requirement gathering stage and planning the the things accordingly. We thought of what is the simplest thing that could work and started with that. During the implementation of the same user story, we also adopted what is becoming a standard solution in the project. 

The 4 rules of simple design pattern speaks about simplicity that is, a design should, in order:

1. passes all tests

2. contain no duplication

3. express all concepts needed

4. minimize the number of classes and methods

Finally the team learned that there are only two ways to design something: so simple that there are obviously no deficiences, and so complex that there are no obvious deficiences.

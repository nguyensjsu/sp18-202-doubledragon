This page is about XP value - "Simplycity" - by Jigar Soni

We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs.

We have followed simplicity in the requirement gathering stage and planning the the things accordingly.

## Double Dragon, Sprint 3

### Team Member Name:

Jigar Soni

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
I made an interface and class structure for collision handler, so that all the teammates can use it in their design.

### What I plan to do this Week:
I am thinking of implementing one class which can handle all the collision properly so that I can use it for future reuse.

### What blockers I have:
I could come up with a solution which works for all, not only for one i.e. I am learning about reusability.

Implement Obstacle class with differnt subclasses for each level (done).

### What I plan to do this Week:
Start working on game implementation and develop basic game board with actors.
Apply design pattern Factory Method in the game implementation. 

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting on Obstacle Factory Implementation for my Board Class implementation.

### Team Member Name:
Vijay Yadav

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Worked on application of Observer design pattern in game.
Developed and set up greenfoot application on local machine.
Implement start and welcome instruction pages.

### What I plan to do this Week:
Implement a class that will interact with other classes and perform an action when the a designated key is pressed.
Apply observer design pattern .

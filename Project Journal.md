## Double Dragon, Sprint 3

### Team Member Name:
Monank Savaliya

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Implemented Factory method design pattern which can be used for creating different obstacles for different levels of the game.

### What I plan to do this Week:
Implement main business logic of the game. 

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting on ConcreteSubject class implementation so that I can implement Board class.

## Double Dragon, Sprint 2

### Team Member Name:
Jigar Soni

### What I plan to do this Week:
Discussed design idea of the game. Studied about various design patterns that could be best fit for different scenarios. 
Created collision handler interface and OliveClass which implements the mentioned interface.

### What blockers I have:
I am thinking of creating different classes which implements the collision handler interface and will try to complete till next sprint. 

### Team Member Name:
Heli Desai

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Discussed the Game idea and which design patterns to use for our project.
Divided the work between teammates.
Created Interfaces IGameInvoker for execution of the game and ICommand for command design pattern. 

### What I plan to do this Week:
Start game implementation and start implementing design pattern Command.

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting on CollisionHandler implementation so that I can implement TrampolineCollision.

### Team Member Name:
Ashish Virani

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Discussed Game Idea and various design patterns that can be used in game.
Created GameState Interface and Game State Class for managing state of game.

### What I plan to do this Week:
Implement State Design pattern in GameManager Class. 

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting on CollisionHandler implementation so that I can implement WallCollision.

### Team Member Name:
Monank Savaliya

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Decide Game idea and Applicatiopn of Design Pattern in Game (done).
Develop simple GreenFoot Project with Images and Background (done).
Implement Obstacle class with differnt subclasses for each level (done).

### What I plan to do this Week:
Start working on game implementation and develop basic game board with actors.
Apply design pattern Factory Method in the game implementation. 

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting on Obstacle Factory Implementation for my Board Class implementation.

### Team Member Name:
Vijay Yadav

### What I did since last weekly scrum:
Worked on application of Observer design pattern in game.
Developed and set up greenfoot application on local machine.
Implement start and welcome instruction pages.

### What I plan to do this Week:
Implement a class that will interact with other classes and perform an action when the a designated key is pressed.
Apply observer design pattern .

### What blockers I have:
I am waiting to collaborate with other team members in other to implement our code perfectly.

## Double Dragon, Sprint 1

### Team Member Name:
Jigar Soni

### What I plan to do this Week:
Study the working of different games. 
Study various game engines.

### What blockers I have:
I think greenfoot is the app engine on which we should start building a small game from scratch.

### Team Member Name:
Heli Desai

### What I plan to do this Week:
Learn about different types of games to decide our game definition.
Learn about the greenfoot basics.

### What blockers I have:
Still to decide final features of the game. We will decide ASAP.

### Team Member Name:
Vijay Yadav

### What I plan to do this Week
Study about how to use greenfoot to build a game.
Also search more on the game ideas and design that would help the team achieve their goal in time.

### What blockers I have:
Learn about some design patterns and how to incorporate them.

### Team Member Name:
Ashish Virani

### What I plan to do this Week:
Researched about various game engines available and complexity of developement.
Finalised Greenfoot for game development as it provides variety of modules and easy building of game
Watched tutorials for how to build game in Greenfoot.

### What blockers I have:
How I will use specific design pattern that will make development more easier.

### Team Member Name:
Monank Savaliya

### What I plan to do this Week:
Research about various game ideas to implement game using greenfoot as it can be used to create programming statements to give the game objects ability to interact with each other..
Learn How to implement simple 2D game using greenfoot game engine with Java Programming.


### What blockers I have:
Lean about how to apply design pattern to problems in game implementation.

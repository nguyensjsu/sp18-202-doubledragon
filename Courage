This page is about XP Core Value - Courage.

- We will be courageous in speaking the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, as this will increase trustful communication. 
- We as a team will discard failing solutions and seek new ones as this will increase simplicity. 

- Instead of saying “we have no access to our end users”, demonstrate the courage to figure out a way to get their feedback.
- We won't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.
- We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

- There are complex problems that might seem impossible to solve. 
- We will have the courage to take action.
- We will do what we can to make a project succeed.

- Everone in the team gave feedback on each other's contribution and everyone welcomed those remarks.
- we discarded some of the irrelavant ideas of the game design because you need to make important decisions and be able to change direction by either discarding or refactoring your work when some of your decisions prove inadequate.

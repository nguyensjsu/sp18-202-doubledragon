This page is about XP Core Value - Courage.

We will be courageous in speaking the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, as this will increase trustful communication. 
We as a team will discard failing solutions and seek new ones as this will increase simplicity. 
Instead of saying “we have no access to our end users”, demonstrate the courage to figure out a way to get their feedback.
We won't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.
We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.
